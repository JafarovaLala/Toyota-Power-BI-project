# Toyota-Power-BI-project
I worked on the Toyota database, using Power Query to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Once the data was ready, I created various analytical reports in Power BI, including: 

•	Map Analysis: Mapping the geographical distribution and trends in sales and services across different regions. 

•	Stock Analysis: Monitoring and analyzing inventory levels, turnover rates, and stock availability. 

•	Churn Analysis: Identifying patterns and factors contributing to customer churn and predicting potential future churn. 

•	Sales Analysis: Examining sales performance, identifying top-selling models, and understanding market demand. 

To enhance the insights, I utilized DAX formulas to create calculated columns and measures, providing a more in-depth data analysis
